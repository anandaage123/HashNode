## ðŸš€ Expanding My Tech Journey: From Web Development to DevOps Mastery

Iâ€™ve recently taken the next step in my career by expanding my journey from **web development into DevOps** â€” a field that harmoniously blends software development and IT operations. For me, this isnâ€™t just about learning tools and processes; itâ€™s about embracing a **culture of collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement** that powers modern software delivery.

With **five years of experience as a web developer**, Iâ€™ve worked closely with deployment processes, server setups, and performance optimization â€” areas that naturally overlap with DevOps. Now, Iâ€™m building on that foundation to dive deeper into **automation, infrastructure as code, and container orchestration**. This transition feels like a natural progression â€” moving from building applications to streamlining the way theyâ€™re delivered, deployed, and maintained.

## ðŸŒ± Why DevOps?

DevOps is all about **speed, quality, and reliability**. It focuses on breaking down silos between development and operations teams, fostering collaboration, and delivering software more efficiently. For me, this journey isnâ€™t just about learning new tools â€” itâ€™s about reshaping how I think about building and managing software systems.

## ðŸ”‘ My DevOps Learning Roadmap

Hereâ€™s my updated step-by-step plan to cover everything:

### **Understand the Fundamentals**

* Revisit the core principles of DevOps: **collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement**.
    
* Deepen knowledge of concepts like **CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), microservices, containers, and cloud computing**.
    
* Strengthen basics in **Linux, networking, and Git**.
    

1. **Programming & Scripting for Automation**
    
    * Use existing coding experience to enhance **Bash scripting and Python** for automation.
        
    * Write scripts for **deployments, backups, and monitoring tasks**.
        
2. **Version Control with Git & GitHub/GitLab**
    
    * Apply branching strategies (**Gitflow, trunk-based development**).
        
    * Use GitHub/GitLab for **collaboration, pull requests, and reviews**.
        
    * Integrate Git workflows with **CI/CD pipelines**.
        
3. **Containerization with Docker**
    
    * Work with **Docker images, containers, and Dockerfiles**.
        
    * Optimize images with **best practices**.
        
    * Run and manage applications inside containers for **portability**.
        
4. **Orchestration with Kubernetes**
    
    * Deploy and scale **containerized applications**.
        
    * Learn **pods, services, deployments, StatefulSets, ConfigMaps, and secrets**.
        
    * Use **Helm charts** to package applications.
        
5. **Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)**
    
    * Build pipelines with **Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI**.
        
    * Automate **testing, builds, and deployments**.
        
    * Explore **blue-green deployments, rolling updates, and canary releases**.
        
6. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
    
    * Learn **Terraform** for defining infrastructure in code.
        
    * Use **Ansible** for configuration management.
        
    * Practice deploying environments on **AWS using IaC principles**.
        
7. **Cloud Platforms (AWS / Azure / GCP)**
    
    * Build expertise in core services: **EC2, S3, VPC, IAM, RDS, Load Balancers**.
        
    * Explore **serverless computing** with Lambda or Cloud Functions.
        
    * Work with managed Kubernetes services (**EKS, AKS, GKE**).
        
8. **Monitoring, Logging & Alerting**
    
    * Implement **Prometheus + Grafana** for monitoring and visualization.
        
    * Use **ELK/EFK stacks** for logging and troubleshooting.
        
    * Configure alerts for **failures, performance drops, and scaling needs**.
        
9. **Security & Compliance (DevSecOps)**
    
    * Implement **secrets management** (Vault, KMS).
        
    * Integrate security checks into CI/CD (**SAST, DAST, dependency scanning**).
        
    * Apply **RBAC and least privilege access policies**.
        
10. **Collaboration & DevOps Culture**
    
    * Strengthen communication between **development, operations, QA, and security teams**.
        
    * Adopt **Agile and Scrum practices** for faster iterations.
        
    * Encourage **blameless postmortems and continuous feedback loops**.
        
11. **Engage with the Community & Keep Learning**
    
    * Join **DevOps communities, forums, and webinars**.
        
    * Contribute to **open-source DevOps tools**.
        
    * Stay updated with trends like **GitOps, FinOps, and AIOps**.
        
12. **Work on Real-World Projects**
    
    * Build end-to-end pipelines: **code â†’ build â†’ test â†’ deploy â†’ monitor**.
        
    * Deploy applications using **Docker + Kubernetes + Terraform + Jenkins**.
        
    * Document projects and showcase them on **GitHub + Hashnode/Medium blog**.
